**R** and **Python** are used as main tools.<br/>
I'm interested in practical analysis that can be done with **Data**.<br/>
Recently, I have a desire to create something in the **psychology** or **behavioral economics** domains.<br/>
Rather than machine learning for mechanical automation, preferring easier, easier, faster analysis.<br/>
I want to produce results in the field of machine learning in the field of social science.
